Notice in the example text below, 'have' is spelled 'hav' so it is pronounced correctly.
Also mp3 is spelled out  M P 3 so it is also pronounced correctly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
In order to create a speaking avatar you need to follow a series of steps.
The first step is to create the text that will be spoken.
Press the button called create the M P 3
The page opened will hav a text area.
Enter the text you wish to hav spoken.
When the text has been enter you must click the submit button.
The M P 3 will be created and played back to you.
The M P 3 file will use the first twenty characters of the text generated as a filename. 
You may wish to hav a copy of the text in case it does not sound right.
Then you just paste it in, correct it, and a new file will be created.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once you hav the M P 3 file it must be converted to a wav format.
Simply press the Convert M P 3 two wave link below this video.
It is super fast and a screen pops up to indicate the process has been completed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
At this point you should have an M P 3 file and it has been converted to a wave file.
Now you must pick an image and convert it to an M P 4.
The M P 4 will be the same length as the M P 3.
That will be done by pressing the,
Create a Video the same length as the wav Created link.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now you hav an M P 4 file and a wav file.
Now for the hard stuff. 
Not for you, but for your computer.
You just click Create Avatar.
If you do not have a G P U, It will probably put your computer to the max.
As soon as you click it you will be directed to page, generate avatar.
Set back and relax it will take some time to generate.
If it is too much for your computer, you will find a link to Jupyter Co lab notebook.
Co Lab provides a free G P U service and is much faster.
